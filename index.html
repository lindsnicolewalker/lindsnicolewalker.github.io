<img class="image" src="assets/portfoliopic.jpg"  alt="Lindsey Walker">After recently earning my AA in mathematics, I realized that
 while I had a real ability with numbers and theories, I had more of a passion for tech. Having no real influences in my immediate 
 family or social circle, I took my interest to the web for hours on end, for months (as many do) to gain a base understanding of how 
 languages, front end, back end, data base, API, UI, and security, all interact for user experience. Learning how to learn with a 
 career aimed trajectory was the biggest challenge. Iâ€™ve felt as though stuck in the learning loop for too long. It is time to network,
  pursue career opportunities and build ideas into products using the skills of a Full Stack Developer.
